# objectos::orm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/objectos/orm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/objectos/orm)

A lightweight Java8 ORM library.

## A simple O/RM

__objectos::orm__ is __not__ meant to be a Hibernate replacement. 
It is a simpler and lighter weight alternative.

Also, it uses annotation processing to generate code, meaning that,
when debugging, all code is visible.

__objectos::orm__ is nothing more than a collection of 
__objectos::pojo__ plugins leveraging two more projects:

- __objectos::schema__ for Java based database schema definition
- __objectos::sql__ for a Java based SQL query writing

## Maven

__objectos::orm__ is at Maven central.
