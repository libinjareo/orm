# objectos::orm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/objectos/orm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/objectos/orm)

A lightweight Java8 ORM library.

## A simple O/RM

__objectos::orm__ is __not__ meant to be a Hibernate replacement. 
It is a simpler and lighter weight alternative.

Also, it uses annotation processing to generate code, meaning that,
when debugging, all code is visible.

__objectos::orm__ is nothing more than a collection of 
__objectos::pojo__ plugins leveraging two more projects:

- __objectos::schema__ for Java based database schema definition
- __objectos::sql__ for a Java based SQL query writing

## A simple mapping

In its simplest form, you just need to annotate your entity class
with a `@Pojo` annotation and its properties with the corresponding
column annotations:

```java
@Pojo
abstract class Employee {

  @EMPLOYEE.EMP_NO
  abstract int emp_no();

  @EMPLOYEE.BIRTH_DATE
  abstract LocalDate birthDate();

  @EMPLOYEE.FIRST_NAME
  abstract String firstName();

  @EMPLOYEE.LAST_NAME
  abstract String lastName();

  @EMPLOYEE.HIRE_DATE
  abstract LocalDate hireDate();

  Employee() {
  }

  // the EmployeeBuilder/Pojo is generated for you 
  public static EmployeeBuilder builder() {
    return new EmployeeBuilderPojo();
  }

}
```

## Maven
